# lein-git-inject

Leiningen middleware which computes the "version" at build-time - from the ambient git context (think latest tag).

Normally, Leiningen projects explicitly provide a `version` within the `project.clj` file, as the 2nd argument to `defproject` 
like this: 
```clj
(defproject my-app "3.4.5"    ;;  <--- "3.4.5" is the version
   ...)
```

But, when using this Leiningen middleware, your `defproject` will not contain an explicit version, and instead will contain a placeholder string, "lein-git-inject/version" like this: 
```clj
(defproject my-app "lein-git-inject/version"   ;; <--- the version is now a placholder string
   ...)
```

Then, at build time, this middleware will:
   1. apply ***a two-rule method*** to compute the "version" from ***the ambient git context***. We refer to this as `the computed version`.
   2. replace the placeholder string with `the computed version`
 
As an added bonus, it also facilitates embedding `the computed version` (and certain other build-time values) 
within your ClojureScript application, making it readily available at run-time for purposes like logging.

## The Ambient Git Context

Imagine you are at the command line in a git repo, and you execute:
```sh
$ git describe --tags --dirty=-dirty
```
If the latest tag in your branch was `v1.0.4`, this command might output something like:
```sh
v1.0.4-3-g975b-dirty
```
which encodes four (hyphen separated) values which we refer to as "the ambient git context":
  - the latest git tag: "v1.0.4"
  - the number of commits the repo is currently "ahead" of that latest tag: "3" 
  - the short ref (SHA) for the commit referenced by that latest tag: "g975b"
  - an indication that there are uncommitted changes: "dirty"  (or absent)
  
## The Two-Rule Method

This middleware creates `the computed version` from these four "ambient" values by applying two rules:
  1. when the "ahead" count is 0, and the repo is not dirty, `the computed version` will just be the latest tag (eg: `1.0.4`)
  2. when the "ahead" count is non-zero, or the repo is dirty, `the computed version` will be the tag suffixed with `-<ahead-count>-<short-ref>-SNAPSHOT`, e.g. `1.0.4-3-g975b-SNAPSHOT`

***Note #1:*** there is a configuration option to ignore `dirty` state. See the Configuration section below.

***Note #2:*** only part of the latest tag is used (just `1.0.4`, not the full string `v1.0.4`) but that's explained in the next section. 

## The Latest Tag

So far, we have said `the computed version` is created using the "latest tag". While that is often true, it is not the whole story, which is acually as follows:
  1. what's used is the "latest version tag" found in the commit history  ("latest version tag" vs "latest tag")
  2. where a "version tag" is a tag with a specific textual structure
  3. by default, that textual structure must match the regex: `#"^v(\d+\.\d+\.\d+)$"`
  4. so, one of these "version tags" might look like: `v1.2.3`  (the string `"v"` followed by a semver, `"N.N.N"`)
  5. tags which do not match the regex are ignored (which means you can use tags for other purposes, not just for nominating versions)
  6. you can override this default regex with one of your own which will recognise an alternative textual structure (see how below)
  7. you'll notice that the regex has a capturing group which extracts just the semver part: "N.N.N". If you provide your own regex, it must contain a single capturing group which isolates that part of the tag to be used in `the computed version`.
  
So, this middleware will traverse backwards through the history of the current commit looking for a tag which has the right structure (matches the regex), and when it finds one, it is THAT tag which is used to create `the computed version` - it is that tag against which the "ahead count" will be calculated, etc.

## Sharp Edges
  
Please be aware of the following: 
  - if no matching tag is found then `the computed version` will be `git-version-tag-not-found`
  - this middleware obtains the "ambient git context" by shelling out to the `git` executable. If this executable is not in the PATH, then you'll see messages on `stderr` and `the computed version` will be `git-command-not-found`
  - `lein release` will massage the `version` in your `defproject` in unwanted ways unless you take specific actions to stop it (see the "Annotated Example" below) 

## The Two Steps

The two-step narative presented above says this middleware:
  1. creates `the computed version` 
  2. replaces a placeholder string within `defproject` with `the computed version`

While that's true, it is a simplification. The real steps are:
  1. this middleware computes **four** build-time values, of which `the computed version` is just one
  2. this middleware will perform a search and replace across ***all the `EDN`*** in 
the `defproject`, looking for four special string values and, where they are found, it will replace them with the associated computed value from step 1. 

So, the special string "lein-git-inject/version" will be replaced ***anywhere*** it is found within the `defproject` EDN, and not just if it appears as the `defproject` version argument.

When you consider this second step, keep in mind that Leiningen middleware runs 
very early in the Lein build pipeline. So early, in fact, that it can alter the `EDN` 
of your `defproject` before it is interpreted by Lein. 

The four special strings supported - referred to as `substitution keys` - are: 


|   substitution key                    |    example replacement       |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| "lein-git-inject/version"             |  "12.4.1-2-453a730-SNAPSHOT" |
| "lein-git-inject/build-iso-date-time" |  "2019-11-18T00:05:02.273361"|      
| "lein-git-inject/build-iso-date-week" |  "2019-W47-2"                |
| "lein-git-inject/user-name"           | "Isaac"                      |

***Note #1:*** to debug these substitutions, I'd recommend adding the [lein-pprint plugin](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/tree/master/lein-pprint), so you can use `lein pprint` 
to see the entire project map after the substitutions have taken place.

***Note #2:***  the substitution keys are strings, even though 
keywords seem like a more idiomatic choice. Why? Turns out that when you are using the Cursive IDE,
the 2nd argument to `defproject` (the version!) can't be a keyword. 
Only a string can go there because Cursive does its own inspection of your `project.clj` 
independently of Lein and it doesn't like a keyword there, as the 2nd argument.
So string keys were necessary. And there is less cognitive load if there 
is only one way to do something - so we reluctantly said "no" to allowing keyword keys too.

## Embedding Build-Time Values In Your App

This middleware provides a way
to embed any of these four build-time values into our ClojureScript application. 
This is often a very useful outcome - these values are useful at runtime for display and logging purposes. And it can 
be achieved in an automated, DRY way.

The trick is to place the substitution keys into specific places within the `defproject` - ones which control 
the actions of the ClojureScript compiler. We want to take advantage of the [`:closure-defines` feature](https://clojurescript.org/reference/compiler-options#closure-defines) feature of the ClojureScript complier which permits us to "set" values for `defs` at compile time.

Below, the Annotated Example section demonstrates how to achive this outcome using shadow-clj.


## Configuration

A map of configuration options can, optionally, be added to `defproject` via the key `:git-inject`, like this:

```clj
(defproject ....

   :git-inject   { ... }   ;; a map of configuration options

   )
```

The two configuration options are:
  -  `:ignore-dirty?` 
  -  `:version-pattern` 
  
#### :ignore-dirty?

A boolean value which specifies if the dirty state of the repo should be ignored when calculating the version. 

Defaults to `false`.

Can be supplied as an explicit boolean or via an environment variable as the string "true" or "false".

```clj
:git-inject {
  :ignore-dirty? true
}
```
OR
```clj
:git-inject {
  ;; Will only be true if IGNORE_DIRTY environment variable is the string "true"
  ;; If the environment variable is not found, defaults to "false"
  :ignore-dirty? :env/ignore_dirty
}
```

#### :version-pattern

A regex which is used to differentiate between `version tags` and other `tags`. If this regex
matches, then the tag is assumed to be a `version tag`, otherwise the tag will be ignored. 

Defaults to `#"^v(\d+\.\d+\.\d+)$"`

When designing the textual structure for your "version tags", remember that 
git tags are git references and that there are rules about well formedness. 
For example, you can't have a ":" in a tag. See https://git-scm.com/docs/git-check-ref-format

The regex you supply has two jobs:
  1. to "match" version tags 
  2. to return one capturing group which extracts the text within the tag which is to 
     be used as the version itself. In the example below, the regex will match the tag "version/1.2.3" 
     but it will also capture the "1.2.3" part and it is THAT part which will be used in the computed version. 
    
```clj
:git-inject {
  :version-pattern  #"^version\/(.*)$" 
}
```
  
## An Annotated Example

Here's how to write your `project.clj` ... 

```clojure

;; On the next line, note that the version (2nd argument of defproject) is a 
;; `Substitution Key` which will be replaced by `the computed version` which is
;; built from `The Ambient Git Context`, using `The Two-Rule Method`.
(defproject day8/lein-git-inject-example "lein-git-inject/version"
  ...

  :plugins      [[day8/lein-git-inject "0.0.5"]   ;; <--- you must include this plugin
                 [lein-shadow          "0.1.7"]]

  :middleware   [leiningen.git-inject/middleware]  ;; <-- you must include this middleware
  
  
  ;; Embedding
  ;; If you are using the shadow-clj compiler and lein-shadow, the shadow-cljs 
  ;; configuration is put here in project.clj. Below is an example of how to 
  ;; combine this middleware with a `:clojure-define` in order to 
  ;; inject build-time values into your application, for later run-time use.
  ;; 
  ;; You'll notice the use of the substitution key "lein-git-inject/version".  
  ;; At build time, this middleware will replace that keyword with `the computed version`.
  ;; In turn, that value is used within a `:clojure-define` to bind it
  ;; to a var, via a `def` in your code (called `version` within the namespace `some.namespace`). 
  :shadow-cljs {:builds {:app {:target :browser
                               :release {:compiler-options {:closure-defines {some.namespace.version  "lein-git-inject/version"}}}}}}

  ;; Note: by default, lein will change the version in project.clj when you do a `lein release`. 
  ;; To avoid this (because you now want the version to come from the git context at build time), 
  ;; explicitly include the following steps to avoid using the default release process provided by lein. 
  :release-tasks [["vcs" "assert-committed"]
                  ["deploy"]]

  ;; Optional - see the `Configuration` section for explanation
  :git-inject {
    :version-pattern  #"^version\/(.*)$" 
    :ignore-dirty? true}
)
```
